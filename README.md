# data_mining_lab_2

This Jupyter Notebook uses Python and various data visualization libraries to create different graphs and charts based on a loan dataset. The purpose is to visually represent the loan data in a more accessible format.

### Libraries Used
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

### Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is called "loan_data_set.csv". It contains information about loan applicants including their income, credit history, and other factors that may affect their ability to repay the loan.

### Visualizations Created
1. Countplot of "Married" data
1. Countplot of "Self Employed" data
1. Countplot of "Education" data
1. Pie plot of "Property Area" data
1. Histogram of "Applicant Income" data
1. Histogram of "Loan Amount" data
1. Density plot of "Applicant Income" data
1. Box plot of "Loan Amount" data
1. Violin plot of "Loan Amount" data
1. Scatter plot of "Applicant Income" and "Loan Amount" data
1. Scatter plot of "Applicant Income", "Loan Amount", "Gender", "Self Employed", and "Property Area" data
1. Bar plot of "Property Area" and "Applicant Income" data
1. Bar plot of "Property Area", "Applicant Income", and "Gender" data
1. Box plot of "Gender" and "Loan Amount" data
1. Box plot of "Gender", "Loan Amount", and "Self Employed" data
1. Density plots of "Loan Amount" data for each "Property Area"
1. Heatmap of "Property Area" and "Self Employed" data
1. Pairplot of the entire dataset

### Conclusion
These visualizations help to better understand the loan data and how different factors may affect loan approval. They provide a clear way to see patterns and correlations within the data.
